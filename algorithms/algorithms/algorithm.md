A set of instructions used in computer science to resolve a specific problem. Used for calculations and data processing.

## efficiency and tradeoffs

Some algorithms will be more efficiant whe in comes to [[computational complexity]] and some when it comes to [[spatial complexity]]. We need to keep in mind for what device we are programming to pick the best.

For example, when we program for the cloud, space may not be a issue but the computational power is limited. While when we program for a device like PS4 we have powerhouse CPU but the RAM is lacking.
