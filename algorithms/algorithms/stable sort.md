Stable sort is a sort that will guarantee that if items in array come sorted we will return them in same order.

Example: if we sort this array of object by letter, stable sort will return them in same order.

```js
[
	{letter: "a", id: 1},
	{letter: "a", id: 2},
	{letter: "a", id: 3},
	{letter: "a", id: 4},
]
```
